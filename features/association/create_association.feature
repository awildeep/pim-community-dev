  As a user
  I need to be able to manually create an association

    Given I am on the associations page
    And I create a new association

    When I create a new association
    And I fill in the following information in the popin:
      | Code | up_sell |
    And I press the "Save" button
    Then I should be on the "up_sell" association page
